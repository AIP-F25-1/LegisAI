Thomas\\nTable of Contents\\nI. Introduction 1\\nII. The Law 2\\nIII. Positions of the Parties 4\\nIV. Decision 6\\nI. Introduction\\n[1] This is a ruling on a motion dated August 10, 2017, by the Chinese and Southeast Asian Legal Clinic (“CSALC”) which seeks interested party status in the inquiry into the complaint of Amir Attaran against Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (“IRCC”). The motion was brought under Rule 3 of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the “Tribunal”) Rules of Procedure for an Order under Rule 8(1) to grant it interested party status so it could:\\nA) Intervene in this case;\\nB) File a statement of particulars and evidence;\\nC) Make written and oral submissions at the hearing; and\\nD) Call witnesses and evidence at the hearing.\\n[2] CSALC proposed to narrow the scope of its participation two times after filing its motion: firstly by way of letter dated August 22, 2017 (see para. 14 herein); and, finally in its reply to the submissions of the other parties (see para. 18 herein.)\\n[3] Mr. Attaran’s complaint against IRCC was filed with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the “Commission”) on July 28, 2010. The complaint alleged that the significant delay in processing sponsorship applications for parents and grandparents, compared to other categories under the Family Class (as defined in the Regulations to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27), was discriminatory, contrary to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 (the “Act”).\\n[4] On February 22, 2012, the Commission decided that an inquiry into the complaint was not warranted. Mr. Attaran made an application to the Federal Court for a judicial review of the Commission’s refusal to refer the complaint to the Tribunal. The Federal Court dismissed his application and Mr. Attaran then appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal (“FCA”).\\n[5] On February 3, 2015, the FCA allowed the appeal and referred the complaint back to the Commission, finding that it had not adequately addressed the issue of IRCC’s bona fide justification (Attaran v. Canada (A.G.), 2015 FCA 37).\\n[6] Pursuant to section 44(3)(a) of the Act, on September 6, 2016, the Commission requested the Tribunal Chairperson to institute an inquiry into Mr. Attaran’s complaint.\\n[7] The parties to this matter have submitted their Statements of Particulars (SOPs) but dates for the hearing have not yet been set.\\n[8] CSALC is a not-for-profit organization incorporated under the laws of Ontario. It provides free legal services to and acts as an advocacy group for non-English speaking, low-income members of the Chinese, Vietnamese, Cambodian and Laotian communities living in Ontario. CSALC is also involved in law reform and has appeared before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration to make submissions on various topics, including family reunification and family class sponsorship applications. CSALC also engages in test case litigation from time to time. CSALC submits that it is in a unique position to make a contribution to the deliberation of the issues before the Tribunal in Mr. Attaran’s complaint.\\n[9] This is not the first request for interested party status in Mr. Attaran’s inquiry. In the Tribunal’s ruling cited as 2017 CHRT 16 (“Stetskevych”), Ms. Lena Stetskevych’s request was denied as she was not able to convince the Tribunal that she possessed any particular expertise, other than also being a frustrated immigration sponsor. While there were some aspects of her experience similar to Mr. Attaran’s, her involvement as an interested party would not necessarily have added a different perspective to the legal positions already put forward by Mr. Attaran.\\nII. The Law\\n[10] Section 50 of the Act gives the Tribunal discretion to grant interested party status. The onus is on the applicant to demonstrate how its expertise will be of assistance in the determination of the issues before the Tribunal. Interested party status will not be granted if it does not add significantly to the legal positions of the parties representing a similar viewpoint: Schnell v. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc., [2001] C.H.R.D. No. 14 at para. 6 (C.H.R.T.) (QL); Nkwazi v. Canada (Correctional Service), 2000 CanLII 28883 (C.H.R.T.), para. 23 (QL); Warman v. Lemire, 2006 C.H.R.T. 8 at para. 18.\\n[11] In the past, the Tribunal has outlined a test for parties seeking interested party status in Walden v. Canada (Treasury Board), 2011 CHRT 19 (“Walden”). At paragraph 23 of Walden, the Tribunal noted:\\n[23] Concisely put, the case law indicates that interested party status has been granted in the past by the Tribunal in situations where:\\na) the prospective interested party’s expertise will be of assistance to the Tribunal;\\nb) its involvement will add to the legal positions of the parties; and\\nc) the proceeding will have an impact on the moving party’s interests.\\n[12] The Tribunal recently restated the scope of its consideration in First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada (for the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada), 2016 CHRT 11 (“FNCFCS”) suggesting a more holistic approach on a case-by-case basis at para. 3:\\nAn application for interested party status is determined on a case-by-case basis, in light of the specific circumstances of the proceedings and the issues being considered. A person or organization may be granted interested party status if they are impacted by the proceedings and can provide assistance to the Tribunal in determining the issues before it. That assistance should add a different perspective to the positions taken by the other parties and further the Tribunal’s determination of the matter. Furthermore, pursuant to section 48.9(1) of the CHRA, the extent of an interested party’s participation must take into account the Tribunal’s responsibility to conduct proceedings as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow (see Nkwazi v. Correctional Service Canada, 2000 CanLII 28883 (CHRT) at paras. 22-23; Schnell v. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc., 2001 CanLII 25862 (CHRT) at para. 6; Warman v. Lemire, 2008 CHRT 17 at paras. 6-8; and Walden et al. v. Attorney General of Canada (representing the Treasury Board of Canada and Human Resources and Skills Development Canada), 2011 CHRT 19 at paras. 22-23).\\n[13] Rule 8 of the Tribunal’s Rules of Procedure states:\\n8(1) Anyone who is not a party, and who wishes to be recognized by the Panel as an interested party in respect of an inquiry, may bring a motion for an order granting interested party status.\\n8(2) A motion under 8(1) shall comply with the requirements of Rule 3 and shall specify the extent of the desired participation in the inquiry.\\nIII. Positions of the Parties\\n[14] CSALC has submitted a comprehensive brief in support of its motion, and outlined in detail the wealth of experience the organization has in helping immigrant families and participating in law reform initiatives and test case litigation. The original CSALC motion sought an order from the Tribunal for:\\na) Permitting CSALC to intervene in this case;\\nb) Granting interested party status to CSALC;\\nc) Permitting CSALC to file a Statement of Particulars and evidence as the Tribunal may deem appropriate;\\nd) Permitting CSALC to make oral submissions and file written submissions at the hearing;\\ne) Permitting CSALC to call witnesses and evidence at the hearing; and\\nf) Any further or other order that the Tribunal may deem appropriate.\\n[15] By letter dated August 22, 2017, CSALC sought to amend its motion, stating:\\nShould the Tribunal decide not to grant CSALC full party status, in the alternative, we ask that CSALC be granted intervenor status with the right to:\\nBe served with all evidence and documents filed by the parties and copied on the full disclosure from the parties;\\nCross examine witnesses;\\nFile supplementary evidence with leave from the Tribunal; and\\nMake oral and written submissions on the issues arising from the complaint and on the proper public interest remedy, where applicable.\\n[16] The Commission gave no submissions on this motion, but informed the Tribunal by email that it consents to CSALC’s proposed participation.\\n[17] The Respondent opposes CSALC’s motion. It cites the three-part criteria test in Walden and argues that CSALC does not meet any of the criteria. Furthermore, the Respondent submits that CSALC wishes to offer its assistance on issues that are not legal in nature, such as the notion of “Western/non-Western” values which it argues are sociological issues. It further argues that the existence and nature of the adverse impact are not the central issues in this complaint. Rather it is the cause of the alleged adverse impact and whether it is a result of a discriminatory practice and if so, whether it may be justified or not under the Act. The Respondent also argues that CSALC’s participation would unnecessarily lengthen the Tribunal’s proceeding. In the alternative, the Respondent submits that if CSALC is granted interested party status, there should be conditions and limits attached to that participation. The Respondent would prefer any submissions by CSALC to be based only on the evidence presented by the existing parties. It also suggests that participation should be limited to oral and written submissions which should not overlap with those of the other parties nor address new issues.\\n[18] Mr. Attaran opposes CSALC’s request for full participation, but supports CSALC having some limited ability to participate as an interested party. Mr. Attaran reminded the parties and Tribunal that he is an individual complainant, without a dedicated budget and no prospect to recover his costs. He submits that CSALC’s full participation would add greatly to the time and cost of his participation in the inquiry to the extent that it might potentially limit his own ability to participate. Mr. Attaran proposes that CSALC be granted a limited opportunity to intervene on the following terms, which I quote (emphasis in original):\\nA. CSALC may file written evidence, and put forward witnesses to testify viva voce up to a limit of one day in total. This ensures that CSALC it can contribute to the evidentiary record, but without the risk of unduly protracting the hearing.\\nB. CSALC may file a factum of 30 pages on the issue of the Respondent’s compliance with the Canadian Human Rights Act. This will provide CSALC the opportunity to make legal arguments, without unduly protracting the hearing. Further, 30 pages is sufficient because that is the most one gets in Federal Court or the Supreme Court of Canada.\\nC. CSALC may not make submissions on the appropriate remedy. This limitation is appropriate since CSALC is a law firm and not a natural person who would be affected by the remedy.\\nD. CSALC may not have input in scheduling the hearing, but must accept the schedule decided by the Tribunal and the parties. This is to ensure that CSALC does not override my ability to schedule, having regard to when I can get time off work.\\n[19] In Reply to the submissions of the Respondent and Mr. Attaran, CSALC amended its request for participation and proposes intervention on the following terms:\\nA. CSALC be permitted to intervene but restricted to the right to make written submissions based on the evidence adduced by the parties and the Tribunal record; and\\nB. CSALC be granted access to the Tribunal record, including the audio recording of the proceeding, if any, and the evidence adduced by the parties in electronic format.\\n[20] CSALC also points out that it cannot meaningfully participate in the proceeding as a party if hearing dates are set without its input and if its ability to call viva voce evidence is unreasonably limited. Although these concerns are raised, I do not read in CSALC’s Reply submissions as these being conditions precedent to their revised request for participation. Rather, I read these concerns as CSALC’s acknowledgment that it cannot meaningfully participate as a party if the Tribunal imposes the conditions suggested by the Complainant – hence its revised request for limited intervention.\\nIV. Decision\\n[21] From time to time the Tribunal receives applications for interested party status, usually for higher profile cases with a significant public interest. However, many times applicants fail to address whether they will advance different and valuable insights and perspectives that will actually further the Tribunal’s determination of the matter. A successful applicant for interested party status must satisfy the Tribunal that they do possess some expertise or perspective that is not already available or before the Tribunal. Interested party status should not be conferred to give a third party a platform on which to make policy statements unrelated to the inquiry before the Tribunal. Participation should be limited to parties who can demonstrably add to the deliberations of the Tribunal (see FNCFCS, supra).\\n[22] While the Respondent’s argument relies heavily on the test outlined in Walden, I prefer the approach in FNCFCS which takes a more holistic approach to the assessment. The ruling in Stetskevych focused on the applicant’s lack of any particular expertise, and as such she failed to meet the test enumerated in Walden. On the other hand, CSALC has an impressive track record of test case litigation and making representations to Parliamentary committees and I am therefore satisfied that they would bring expertise that could be of assistance to the Tribunal.\\n[23] However, the Tribunal should also remain mindful of the wishes of the parties themselves. I am particularly concerned about the reservations raised by Mr. Attaran. He is acting on his own behalf and has undoubtedly expended much time and expense to bring his complaint this far. The hearing itself is already likely to be time consuming and Mr. Attaran has reason to be concerned about involvement of third parties adding to his time and cost for the participation in his own hearing. When such reservations are raised by a complainant, the Tribunal should be cautious about making a decision that could possibly impede the complainant’s ability to appear at the inquiry, present their evidence and make representations. Mr. Attaran’s concerns are also consistent with the Tribunal’s obligations under section 48.9 (1) of the Act to conduct proceedings as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow.\\n[24] Having taken full stock of the submissions of the parties and the revised scope of CSALC’s requested participation, the Tribunal will permit the limited interested party status of CSALC on the following conditions:\\nA. At the conclusion of the hearing, CSALC will have the right to make written submissions based on the evidence adduced by the parties and the Tribunal record to a maximum of 30 pages;\\nB. The other parties will be given an opportunity to reply in writing to the submissions of CSALC; and\\nC. CSALC will not participate in case management conference calls or other pre-hearing matters and will not have input in to the selection of hearing dates.\\n[25] Pursuant to the public nature of this inquiry, and given that no confidentiality orders have been made in relation thereto, there is nothing to prevent CSALC from being given access to the audio recordings of the hearing and the evidence adduced by the parties.\\nSigned by\\nDavid L.

Thomas\\nTable des matières\\nI. Introduction 1\\nII. Le droit 3\\nIII. Les positions des parties 4\\nIV. Décision 7\\nI. Introduction\\n[1] Cette décision porte sur une requête, datée du 10 août 2017, présentée par la Chinese and Southeast Asian Legal Clinic (la « CSALC »), pour agir en qualité de partie intéressée à l’égard de la plainte déposée par Amir Attaran contre Immigration, Réfugiés et Citoyenneté Canada (« IRCC »). La requête a été présentée conformément à la règle 3 des Règles de procédure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le « Tribunal ») en vue d’obtenir une ordonnance fondée sur la règle 8(1) accordant à la CSALC le statut de partie intéressée afin qu’elle puisse :\\nA) Intervenir en l’espèce;\\nB) Déposer un exposé des précisions et des éléments de preuve;\\nC) Présenter des observations écrites et orales à l’audience;\\nD) Citer des témoins et témoigner à l’audience.\\n[2] Après le dépôt de sa requête, la CSALC a proposé à deux reprises de limiter la portée de sa participation : tout d’abord dans une lettre datée du 22 août 2017 (voir le paragraphe 14, ci-après), et finalement dans sa réplique aux observations des autres parties (voir le paragraphe 18, ci-après).\\n[3] La plainte de M. Attaran à l’encontre d’IRCC a été déposée devant la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la « Commission ») le 28 juillet 2010. Dans cette plainte, M. Attaran a allégué que les retards importants dans le traitement des demandes de parrainage de parents et de grands-parents, comparativement à d’autres catégories du regroupement familial (au sens du Règlement d’application de la Loi sur l’immigration et la protection des réfugiés, L.C. 2001, ch. 27), étaient discriminatoires, allant ainsi à l’encontre de l’article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6 (la « Loi »).\\n[4] Le 22 février 2012, la Commission a décidé que l’instruction de la plainte n’était pas justifiée. M. Attaran a ensuite présenté une demande de contrôle judiciaire auprès de la Cour fédérale afin que celle-ci examine le refus de la Commission de renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal. La Cour fédérale a rejeté sa demande; M. Attaran a alors interjeté appel de cette décision auprès de la Cour d’appel fédérale (la « CAF »).\\n[5] Le 3 février 2015, la CAF a accueilli l’appel et renvoyé la plainte à la Commission, après avoir conclu que celle-ci n’avait pas examiné adéquatement la question du motif justifiable invoquée par IRCC (Attaran c. Canada (P.G.), 2015 CAF 37).\\n[6] Le 6 septembre 2016, conformément à l’article 44(3)a) de la Loi, la Commission a demandé au président du Tribunal de désigner un membre pour instruire la plainte présentée par M. Attaran.\\n[7] Les parties en l’espèce ont soumis leurs exposés des précisions respectifs, mais les dates de l’audience n’ont pas encore été fixées.\\n[8] La CSALC est une organisation à but non lucratif constituée en personne morale en vertu des lois de l’Ontario. Elle offre gratuitement des services juridiques aux membres des communautés chinoises, vietnamiennes, cambodgiennes et laotiennes à faible revenu qui habitent en Ontario et qui ne parlent pas anglais. Elle agit en tant que groupe de défense de leurs droits. La CSALC participe aussi à la réforme du droit et elle a comparu devant le Comité parlementaire permanent de la citoyenneté et de l’immigration afin de présenter des observations relatives à divers sujets, notamment la réunification des familles et les demandes de parrainage pour la catégorie du regroupement familial. De plus, la CSALC participe occasionnellement à des causes types. La CSALC soutient qu’elle est dans une position privilégiée pour contribuer aux délibérations sur les questions dont le Tribunal est saisi dans le cadre de la plainte de M. Attaran.\\n[9] Il ne s’agit pas de la première requête pour agir en qualité de partie intéressée dans le cadre de la demande de M. Attaran. Dans la décision sur requête 2017 TCDP 16 (« Stetskevych »), le Tribunal a rejeté la requête de Mme Lena Stetskevych, car cette dernière n’a pas été en mesure de convaincre le Tribunal qu’elle possédait une expertise particulière, en dehors du fait qu’elle soit elle aussi une répondante en matière d’immigration dont les efforts ont été contrariés. Bien que, à certains égards, son expérience était similaire à celle de M. Attaran, son intervention à titre de partie intéressée n’aurait pas nécessairement apporté un point de vue différent sur les positions juridiques déjà mises en avant par M. Attaran.\\nII. Le droit applicable\\n[10] L’article 50 de la Loi confère au Tribunal le pouvoir discrétionnaire d’accorder à une personne le statut de partie intéressée. Il incombe au requérant de démontrer en quoi son expertise aidera à trancher les questions en litige. Le statut de partie intéressée ne sera pas accordé s’il ne contribue pas de façon importante aux positions juridiques des parties alléguant un point de vue semblable : Schnell c. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc., [2001] CHRD No 14, au paragraphe 6 (TCDP) (QL); Nkwazi c. Service correctionnel du Canada, 2000 CanLII 28883 (TCDP), au paragraphe 23 (QL); Warman c. Lemire, 2006 TCDP 8, au paragraphe 18.\\n[11] Le Tribunal a déjà précisé, dans Walden c. Canada (Conseil du Trésor), 2011 TCDP 19 (« Walden »), les critères auxquels doivent satisfaire les parties afin d’obtenir le statut de partie intéressée. Au paragraphe 23 de Walden, le Tribunal a déclaré :\\n[23] En bref, la jurisprudence indique que le statut de partie intéressée a déjà été accordé par le Tribunal dans les situations où :\\na) l’expertise de l’éventuelle partie intéressée aiderait le Tribunal;\\nb) sa participation ajouterait à la position juridique des parties;\\nc) l’instance pourrait avoir des répercussions sur les intérêts de la partie requérante.\\n[12] Le Tribunal, dans Société de soutien à l’enfance et à la famille des Premières Nations du Canada et al. c. Procureur général du Canada (pour le ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), 2016 TCDP 11 (« SSEFPN ») a récemment réitéré la portée de son examen en proposant une approche plus globale, fondée sur le cas par cas, au paragraphe 3 :\\nLes demandes visant l’obtention du statut de partie intéressée sont tranchées au cas par cas, en tenant compte des circonstances particulières de l’instance et des questions qui sont en train d’être examinées. Une personne ou une organisation peut se voir accorder le statut de partie intéressée si l’instance a des incidences sur elle et si elle peut aider le Tribunal à trancher les questions dont il est saisi. Cette aide doit apporter un éclairage différent aux thèses défendues par les autres parties et contribuer à la prise de décision par le Tribunal. Par ailleurs, en vertu du paragraphe 48.9(1) de la LCDP, l’un des principes qui doit sous-tendre la décision sur l’étendue de la participation d’une partie intéressée est que le Tribunal doit instruire les plaintes sans formalisme et de façon expéditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des règles de pratique (voir Nkwazi c. Service correctionnel Canada, 2000 CanLII 28883 (TCDP), par. 22-23; Schnell c. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc., 2001 CanLII 25862 (TCDP), par. 6; Warman c. Lemire, 2008 TCDP 17, par. 6-8; et Walden et autres c. Procureur général du Canada (représentant le Conseil du Trésor du Canada et Ressources humaines et Développement des compétences Canada), 2011 TCDP 19, par. 22-23).\\n[13] La règle 8 des Règles de procédure du Tribunal prévoit ce qui suit :\\n8(1) Une personne qui n’est pas une partie et qui souhaite être reconnue par le membre instructeur comme partie intéressée à l’égard d’une instruction peut présenter une requête à cet effet.\\n8(2) Toute requête présentée conformément au paragraphe 8(1) doit se conformer aux exigences énoncées à la règle 3 et doit préciser le degré de participation à l’instruction recherché.\\nIII. Les positions des parties\\n[14] La CSALC a déposé un mémoire très complet à l’appui de sa requête et a décrit en détail la vaste expérience de l’organisation en matière d’aide aux familles immigrantes et dans le cadre de sa participation aux réformes du droit et aux causes types. La requête initiale de la CSALC demandait au Tribunal de rendre une ordonnance prévoyant ce qui suit :\\na) autoriser la CSALC à intervenir en l’espèce;\\nb) accorder le statut de partie intéressée à la CSALC;\\nc) autoriser la CSALC à déposer un exposé des précisions et des éléments de preuve, selon ce que le Tribunal juge approprié;\\nd) autoriser la CSALC à présenter des observations orales et écrites à l’audience;\\ne) autoriser la CSALC à citer des témoins et à témoigner à l’audience;\\nf) toute autre ordonnance que le Tribunal juge appropriée.\\n[15] Dans une lettre datée du 22 août 2017, la CSALC a cherché à modifier sa requête, comme suit :\\n[traduction]\\nDans l’éventualité où le Tribunal décidait de ne pas accorder le statut de partie à part entière à la CSALC, nous demandons, subsidiairement, que la CSALC se voit accorder le statut d’intervenant et les droits suivants :\\nque toute la preuve et la documentation déposées par les parties lui soient signifiées et que la divulgation complète des parties lui soit envoyée en copie conforme;\\nqu’elle puisse contre-interroger les témoins;\\nqu’elle puisse présenter une preuve supplémentaire, avec l’autorisation du Tribunal;\\nqu’elle puisse déposer des observations orales et écrites sur les questions découlant de la plainte et les mesures d’intérêt public appropriées, le cas échéant.\\n[16] La Commission n’a présenté aucune observation relativement à la présente requête. Elle a informé le Tribunal, par courriel, qu’elle consentait à la participation proposée de la CSALC.\\n[17] L’intimé s’oppose à la requête de la CSALC. Il cite le critère à trois volets établi dans Walden et fait valoir que la CSALC ne satisfait à aucun de ces critères. De plus, il soutient que la CSALC souhaite offrir son aide relativement à des questions qui ne sont pas de nature juridique, telle que la notion de valeurs [traduction] « occidentales et non occidentales », lesquels, soutient-il, sont des préoccupations sociologiques. Il soutient également que l’existence et la nature de l’effet préjudiciable ne sont pas des questions fondamentales en l’espèce. Le motif de l’effet préjudiciable allégué et la question de savoir s’il découle d’un acte discriminatoire et, le cas échéant, s’il peut être justifié au regard de la Loi, sont au cœur de cette affaire. Il soutient aussi que la participation de la CSALC allongerait inutilement l’instruction de la plainte par le Tribunal. Subsidiairement, il demande que, dans l’éventualité où le statut de partie intéressée était accordé à la CSALC, cette participation devrait faire l’objet de restrictions et de conditions. Il préférerait que toutes observations formulées par la CSALC soient fondées uniquement sur la preuve présentée par les parties existantes. Il propose également que cette participation soit limitée à des observations orales et écrites, qui ne devraient ni recouper celles des autres parties ni porter sur de nouvelles questions.\\n[18] M. Attaran s’oppose à la requête de participation intégrale présentée par la CSALC. Il appuie toutefois l’octroi, dans une capacité limitée, du statut de partie intéressée à la CSALC. M. Attaran a rappelé aux parties et au Tribunal qu’il est un plaignant individuel et qu’il ne dispose d’aucun budget spécial ni d’aucune possibilité de recouvrer ses frais. Il soutient que la participation à part entière de la CSALC augmenterait grandement les coûts et le temps qu’il devra consacrer à sa participation à l’instruction, à tel point que sa propre capacité à participer pourrait potentiellement être limitée. M. Attaran propose que la CSALC se voit accorder une possibilité limitée d’intervenir, selon les conditions suivantes, que je cite (le passage en évidence l’est dans l’original) :\\n[traduction]\\nA. La CSALC peut déposer des observations écrites et citer des témoins à témoigner de vive voix, dans la mesure où une seule journée y est consacrée. Ainsi, la CSALC pourra contribuer au dossier de la preuve, sans risquer de prolonger excessivement l’audience.\\nB. La CSALC peut déposer un mémoire de 30 pages sur la question du respect, par l’intimé, de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Ainsi, la CSALC pourra présenter des arguments juridiques sans risquer de prolonger excessivement l’audience. De plus, 30 pages suffisent puisqu’il s’agit de la limite accordée par la Cour fédérale ou la Cour suprême du Canada.\\nC. La CSALC ne peut pas formuler d’observations relativement à la réparation appropriée. Cette limite est appropriée puisque la CSALC est un cabinet d’avocats et non pas une personne physique qui serait touchée par la réparation.\\nD. La CSALC ne peut pas formuler de commentaires quant à la mise au rôle de l’audience, elle doit accepter l’horaire prévu par le Tribunal et les parties. Par conséquent, la CSALC n’a aucun droit de regard sur ma capacité à planifier mes horaires en fonction des jours où je peux obtenir un congé de travail.\\n[19] En réplique aux observations de l’intimé et de M. Attaran, la CSALC a modifié sa requête pour participation et a proposé qu’on l’autorise à intervenir, comme suit :\\n[Traduction]\\nA. Que la CSALC soit autorisée à intervenir, mais que sa capacité soit limitée au droit de déposer des observations écrites fondées sur la preuve présentée par les parties et sur le dossier du Tribunal;\\nB. Que la CSALC ait accès au dossier du Tribunal, y compris l’enregistrement sonore de l’audience, s’il en existe, et la preuve en format électronique présentée par les parties.\\n[20] La CSALC souligne également qu’elle ne peut pas participer de façon significative en tant que partie à l’instance si les dates d’audience sont prévues sans qu’elle ait un mot à dire et si sa capacité de citer des personnes à témoigner de vive voix est déraisonnablement limitée. Malgré ces préoccupations, je n’interprète pas les observations formulées par la CSALC en réplique comme étant des conditions préalables à sa requête révisée pour participation. Selon mon interprétation de ces préoccupations, la CSALC reconnait qu’elle ne peut pas participer de façon significative en tant que partie si le Tribunal impose les conditions proposées par le plaignant et, pour cette raison, elle a modifié sa requête pour participation en une requête visant une intervention limitée.\\nIV. Décision\\n[21] De temps à autre, le Tribunal reçoit des demandes pour agir en qualité de partie intéressée. Habituellement, ces demandes sont liées à des affaires qui ont une grande visibilité et qui revêtent un intérêt public important. Or, bien souvent, les demandeurs n’abordent pas la question de savoir s’ils fourniront au Tribunal des précisions et perspectives supplémentaires utiles, qui aideront réellement le Tribunal dans sa prise de décision. Pour que sa demande soit accueillie, la personne qui présente une requête pour agir en qualité de partie intéressée doit convaincre le Tribunal qu’elle détient une expertise ou une perspective dont le Tribunal ne dispose pas déjà. Le statut de partie intéressée ne devrait pas être accordé à un tiers afin de lui servir de tribune pour faire des déclarations de principe sans lien avec l’affaire dont le Tribunal est saisi. Une telle participation devrait être limitée aux parties qui peuvent contribuer aux délibérations du Tribunal (voir SSEFPN, précitée).\\n[22] Tandis que l’argument de l’intimé repose en grande partie sur le critère décrit dans Walden, je préfère l’approche retenue dans SSEFPN, c’est-à-dire une approche plus globale quant à l’évaluation. La décision rendue dans Stetskevych portait principalement sur le manque d’expertise particulière de la requérante; par conséquent, elle ne satisfaisait pas aux critères établis dans Walden. La CSALC possède, pour sa part, des antécédents impressionnants en matière de causes types et de comparution devant des comités parlementaires. Je suis, par conséquent, convaincu qu’elle possède une expertise qui serait utile au Tribunal.\\n[23] Cependant, le Tribunal devrait garder à l’esprit les souhaits exprimés par les parties. Les réserves exprimées par M. Attaran me préoccupent particulièrement. Il se représente seul et il a, sans aucun doute, consacré beaucoup de temps et d’efforts à porter sa plainte aussi loin. L’audience en elle-même risque de nécessiter beaucoup de temps et M. Attaran a raison de s’inquiéter du fait que la participation de tierces parties pourrait augmenter le temps et les frais qu’il devra consacrer pour participer à sa propre audience. Lorsque de telles préoccupations sont exprimées par un plaignant, le Tribunal doit veiller à ne pas prendre une décision qui pourrait nuire à la capacité du plaignant de comparaître à l’audience, de présenter des éléments de preuve et de faire des observations. Les préoccupations de M. Attaran correspondent à l’obligation du Tribunal, prévue au paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi, d’instruire les plaintes sans formalisme et de façon expéditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des règles de pratique.\\n[24] Après avoir examiné l’ensemble des observations formulées par les parties et la portée révisée de la demande de participation de la CSALC, le Tribunal accorde à la CSALC le statut limité de partie intéressée, aux conditions suivantes :\\nA. À la conclusion de l’audience, la CSALC aura le droit de déposer des observations écrites, d’au plus 30 pages, fondées sur la preuve produite par les parties et le dossier du Tribunal;\\nB. Les autres parties auront l’occasion de répondre, par écrit, aux observations de la CSALC;\\nC. La CSALC ne participera pas aux conférences téléphoniques de gestion de cas ou aux autres questions préalables à l’audience, et ne participera pas à la sélection des dates d’audience;\\n[25] Compte tenu de la nature publique de la présente audience, et comme aucune ordonnance de confidentialité n’a été rendue relativement à l’enquête, rien n’empêche la CSALC d’avoir accès aux enregistrements sonores de l’audience et à la preuve produite par les parties.\\nSignée par\\nDavid L.

Hadjis\\n[1] This ruling concerns the issue of whether the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) and the Complainant are obliged to disclose the minutes of settlement regarding two other human rights complaints.\\n[2] The Complainant and the Respondent are both employed by Canada Post Corporation. In 1998, they were also members of the local executive of their union, the Union of Postal Communications Employees (UPCE), which is a component of the Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC). The Complainant claims that Respondent sexually harassed her on an ongoing basis, during the course of his membership on the executive. As a result of this alleged harassment, the Complainant filed human rights complaints against the Respondent, the UPCE and the PSAC.\\n[3] The complaints against the unions (Commission File Nos. H48451 & H48449) were settled in December 2002. The terms of the settlement have since been approved by the Commission, pursuant to s. 48 of the Act. A settlement was not, however, reached with the Respondent, and the hearing as to the merits of the complaint against him began on January 13, 2003. A second set of hearing dates is scheduled to commence on February 17, 2003.\\n[4] The Respondent has taken issue with the fact that a copy of the minutes of settlement with the unions has not been disclosed to him. Although the Respondent is not represented by legal counsel and is acting on his own behalf, I understand him to be contending that he is entitled to have this document communicated to him, in accordance with Rule 6(3) of the Tribunal's Interim Rules of Procedure. This rule, when read together with Rule 6(1)(d), obliges a party to provide to other parties, copies of all documents in its possession which are relevant to any matter in issue in the case and for which no privilege is claimed. The test for relevance for these purposes has been expressed as being whether the document in question is arguably relevant to the hearing.(1)\\n[5] The Commission and the Complainant are unwilling to disclose the minutes of settlement. Instead, the Commission has informed the Respondent in writing of what the Commission identifies as a general recounting of the terms of the settlement. This summary consists of four paragraphs that are set out in point form. It purportedly reflects all the essential terms of the agreement (minus the technical language), with one significant exception: the specific monetary amounts that the unions undertook to pay the Complainant have been excluded. Together with the summary, the Respondent was provided with a copy of the letter of apology from the unions to the Complainant, which was drafted in accordance with the terms of the agreement. According to Commission counsel, a single document was drafted to reflect the settlement of both complaints. The minutes of settlement contain a clause by which the parties agree to keep the terms of the agreement confidential.\\n[6] The Respondent is not satisfied with this level of disclosure and has specifically requested communication of the amounts paid by the unions to the Complainant. I should point out that I have not viewed the minutes of settlement in question.\\n[7] Considering the fact that the unions, who are not parties before the Tribunal in this case, were signatories to the agreement, I felt it appropriate to request their opinions with respect to this disclosure issue. Their joint position was expressed in a letter from Mr. Craig Spencer, Legal Counsel, PSAC Membership Programs Branch. The unions concur with the Complainant and the Commission that the Minutes of Settlement should not be disclosed in their entirety. The objections of the Commission and the Complainant are seemingly limited to the disclosure of the actual financial settlement amounts. They are amenable to the communication of the remainder of the minutes of settlement.\\nI. IS THE DOCUMENT RELEVANT TO A MATTER IN ISSUE IN THE CASE? [8] The unions submit, with the apparent concurrence of the Commission and the Complainant, that the matters in issue in the settled complaints are completely unrelated and irrelevant to the matters in issue in the complaint against the Respondent. The latter complaint alleges specific actions in violation of the Canadian Human Rights Act (Act) by the Respondent. The complaints against the unions, on the other hand, although triggered by the alleged actions of the Respondent, are distinct in that they deal specifically with the administrative framework developed by the PSAC and the UPCE to review complaints of harassment in the context of union activity. As is evident from the text of the complaints against the unions, the Complainant believes that the system for dealing with harassment issues that was in place within the unions failed to deliver to her a timely review of her concerns.\\n[9] Indeed, a significant portion of both complaints against these labour organizations is focussed on the manner in which senior union representatives had mismanaged her complaints to them regarding the Respondent's conduct. In the human rights complaint filed with the Commission against the Respondent, a contravention of s. 14 of the Act is alleged only. This provision makes it a discriminatory act to harass a person based on a prohibited ground, including sex. With respect to the complaints filed against the union, however, violations of s. 7, s. 9 as well as s. 14 are alleged. Under s. 7, it is a discriminatory practice to differentiate adversely in the course of a person's employment and, of greater significance, pursuant to s. 9, it is a discriminatory practice for an employee organization to exclude, expel or suspend a member of the organization on a prohibited ground, such as sex. Thus, the liability that the Commission sought to attach to the unions was based, at least in part, on the manner in which they treated their member, as a consequence of her allegations that another union executive member had sexually harassed her.\\n[10] The unions argue that they could have been found liable, irrespective of the outcome of the complaint against the Respondent. The unions' counsel suggested that if the Tribunal were to find that the Respondent had not harassed the Complainant, the unions would not seek to reopen or seek to invalidate the settlement.\\n[11] It is pointed out that the only significant portions of the settlement terms that are being withheld are the settlement amounts. In light of the discrete liabilities of the unions on the one hand and the Respondent on the other, the sums paid to the Complainant by the unions are of no relevance to the amounts that she is claiming from the Respondent. The Commission notes that according to the summary of the minutes of settlement referred to above, compensation was to be paid by the unions to the Complainant to address the Complainant's pain and suffering pursuant to s. 53(2)(e) of the Act only. No payment was made in respect of lost wages (that is, honoraria to which union executives were entitled) or expenses. Turning to the present case, the Commission's and Complainant's Joint Letter of Particulars indicates that financial compensation for the Complainant's expenses is being claimed against the Respondent, as well as an award for pain and suffering, pursuant to s. 53(2)(e).\\n[12] Thus, compensation for pain and suffering was claimed against the Respondent as well as the unions. The Commission argues that these remedies are nonetheless unrelated. The Complainant was entitled to claim up to the maximum amount allowable for pain and suffering under the Act ($20,000.00) against each of the original respondents. Commission counsel directed me to the findings in Ghosh v. Domglas Inc. (No. 2),(2) with respect to the remedial provision in the Ontario Human Rights Code that authorizes a Board of Inquiry to order an award of up to $10,000 as monetary compensation for mental anguish. The Board stated that:\\nWhile the Code limits the amount of an award of monetary compensation in respect of mental anguish, it does not restrict the number of such awards a board may order after a hearing where it finds distinct rights to have been infringed in separate incidents, or series of incidents, and whether by the same or by different respondents.(3)\\nA similar finding was reached in the more recent Ontario Board of Inquiry decision in Moffat v. Kinark Child and Family Services.(4)\\n[13] The Commission contends that the same reasoning can be extended to the remedial provisions under the Act, including s. 50(2)(e). If the remedies for pain and suffering are distinct, from one complaint to another, the sums received by the Complainant from the unions cannot be set off against those that she is claiming from the Respondent. Therefore, the amounts that the Complainant may have received from the other respondents are of no relevance to the claim for pain and suffering that she has addressed against the Respondent in the present case.\\n[14] This argument assumes that the Tribunal will be in a position to distinguish the pain and suffering that the Complainant experienced at the hands of the Respondent from the pain and suffering arising from the unions' conduct. It is possible that the Tribunal will be unable to make such a determination. The three human rights complaints and the Joint Letter of Particulars all suggest that a significant portion of the unions' actions and omissions occurred at the same time as the Respondent was purportedly harassing the Complainant. In the event that I sustain the complaint against the Respondent and find that the Complainant experienced pain and suffering over the period in question, it is certainly possible that I will be unable to separate out the injury caused by the Respondent's conduct from that of the unions. In this event, the Respondent could argue that he should not be ordered to compensate the Complainant for all her pain and suffering. At least for the purpose of avoiding a double indemnification of the Complainant, knowledge of whatever amounts she may have received from the unions is relevant to a matter in issue in the Respondent's case. On this basis alone, I find that the settlement document is arguably relevant.\\n[15] But is the liability of the unions really as distinct as it has been made out to be? It is true that the complaints against the labour organizations refer to s. 7 and s. 9 of the Act and mention the specific conduct of the unions and their representatives. However, according to the Commission's and Complainant's Joint Letter of Particulars, which was prepared before the complaints against the unions were settled, the issues of the case include the following:\\nDid the Respondents UPCE and PSAC fail to exercise due diligence in preventing the acts of harassment from occurring or mitigate the effect of the harassment on the Complainant, per section 65 of the Act?\\nS. 65(1) is the provision of the Act in virtue of which acts or omissions committed by officers, directors, employees or agents of an organization are deemed to be acts or omissions committed by the organization - in other words, deemed or vicarious liability. Under s. 65(2), the organization may exculpate itself by demonstrating that it did not consent to those acts or omissions, it exercised all due diligence to prevent them and it tried subsequently to mitigate their effects.\\n[16] As is implied by the Complainant's and the Commission's reference to s. 65, the liability of the unions could flow from the principal liability of the alleged harasser, the Respondent. In these circumstances, organizations may be condemned jointly and severally with their officers, directors, employees or agents, to compensate complainants. As was explained in Moffat:\\nIn those decisions, where the corporate respondent is found to be liable for the discriminatory conduct of a personal respondent, the order holds the corporate respondent jointly and severally liable with the individual for the award in respect of that conduct.(5)\\nThe Board of Inquiry in Moffat went on to note that a finding of deemed or vicarious liability does not support a further separate award in respect of that liability.(6)\\n[17] Accordingly, it could certainly be argued that the liability alleged against the unions flows vicariously from the liability of the Respondent, and that the Complainant's damage claim against him should be reduced by the sums received in settlement of her complaints against the unions. The settlement amounts thus become relevant the Respondent's case.\\n[18] For all these reasons, I am satisfied that the minutes of settlement are relevant to a matter in issue in the case, namely, the determination of the amount of the award that the Respondent may be ordered to pay if he is found liable.\\nII. IS THE DOCUMENT PRIVILEGED? [19] In his written submissions, counsel for the unions noted that in practice, parties to settlement negotiations undertake to maintain strict confidentiality as a motivation to parties to reconcile their differences and avoid litigation. Any societal interest in the terms of the agreement is protected through the process of review and approval by the Commission that must be completed before the settlement becomes enforceable, pursuant to s. 48 of the Act.\\n[20] Indeed, in furtherance of this objective, courts have protected from disclosure communications made with a view to reconciliation or settlement.(7) However, as explained by Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant, if negotiations are successful and result in a consensual agreement, the communications may be tendered in proof of the settlement, where the existence or interpretation of the agreement is itself in issue.(8) I note that the authors' discussion regarding this privilege appears to revolve around the communications leading up to the settlement, not the settlement document itself. By implication, I take it that minutes of settlement would not be subject to the privilege. At any rate, I am satisfied that the questions regarding the assessment of damages for pain and suffering are issues that relate to the interpretation of the settlement agreement itself. I am therefore not persuaded that a privilege extends to the minutes of settlement.\\nIII. CONCLUSION AND ORDER [21] I order the Commission and the Complaint to disclose to the Respondent, by 4:00 PM, on Thursday, February 13, 2003, the minutes of the settlement with the PSAC and the UPCE. This disclosure shall be in the form of copies of the document, in accordance with Rule 6(3) of the Tribunal's Interim Rules of Procedure.\\n[22] In order to address some of the concerns as to the confidentiality of the documents, I order the disclosure of the document on the following conditions:\\nThe Respondent shall only consult the document for the purposes of the hearing; The Respondent shall not disclose the document nor its content to anyone, other than his legal counsel, if any; The Respondent shall not make any additional copies of the disclosed document and shall return it to the Commission within one week after the close of the hearing in this case.\\n[23] Any similar concerns regarding the admission of the document into evidence during the hearing can be addressed at that time, perhaps through a motion for in camera proceedings.\\nOriginal signed by\\nAthanasios D.

Hadjis\\n2003 TCDP 5\\n2003/02/11\\n[TRADUCTION]\\n[1] La présente décision porte sur la question à savoir si la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) et la plaignante sont tenues de divulguer le compte rendu du règlement de deux autres plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne.\\n[2] La plaignante et l’intimé sont tous deux à l’emploi de la Société canadienne des postes. En 1998, ils étaient tous les deux membres de l’exécutif de la section locale de leur syndicat, le Syndicat des employés des postes et des communications (le SEPC), qui est un élément de l’Alliance de la Fonction publique du Canada (l’AFPC). La plaignante prétend que l’intimé l’a harcelée sexuellement de façon continue durant la période où elle a fait partie de l’exécutif. Par suite de ce présumé harcèlement, elle a déposé auprès de la Commission des plaintes contre l’intimé, le SEPC et l’AFPC.\\n[3] Les plaintes portées contre les syndicats (dossiers de la Commission nos H48451 et H48449) ont été réglées en décembre 2002. Les conditions du règlement ont depuis été approuvées par la Commission, conformément à l’article 48 de la Loi. Toutefois, il n’y a pas eu d’entente avec l’intimé, et l’audience sur le fond de la plainte dont il est l’objet a débuté le 13 janvier 2003. Une deuxième série de dates ont été fixées pour l’audience, qui doit débuter le 17 février 2003.\\n[4] L’intimé a contesté le fait qu’on ne lui ait communiqué aucune copie du compte rendu du règlement conclu avec les syndicats. Bien que l’intimé ne soit pas représenté par avocat et agisse en son propre nom, je crois comprendre qu’il soutient avoir droit à ce que ce document lui soit communiqué, conformément au paragraphe 6(3) des Règles de procédure provisoires du Tribunal. Ce paragraphe, s’il est lu de concert avec l’alinéa 6(1)d), oblige une partie à fournir aux autres parties une copie de tous les documents en sa possession qui sont pertinents à toute question en cause et pour lesquels aucun privilège de non-divulgation n’est invoqué. Le critère qui s’applique à cet égard consiste en fait à déterminer si les documents en question sont potentiellement pertinents à l’égard de l’audience.\\n[5] La Commission et la plaignante ne sont pas disposées à divulguer le compte rendu du règlement. La Commission a plutôt soumis à l’intimé un écrit qu’elle qualifie de [TRADUCTION] sommaire général des conditions de règlement. Ce sommaire, qui est présenté sous forme télégraphique, comporte quatre paragraphes. Il se veut un résumé de l’ensemble des éléments essentiels de l’entente (dépouillée de son langage technique), à une exception près : on n’a pas indiqué les sommes d’argent que les syndicats se sont engagés à verser à la plaignante. Outre le sommaire, l’intimé a reçu copie de la lettre d’excuses des syndicats à la plaignante, qui a été rédigée conformément aux conditions de l’entente. Selon l’avocat de la Commission, le règlement des deux plaintes a donné lieu à la rédaction d’un seul et même document. Le compte rendu du règlement comporte une clause de non-divulgation des conditions du règlement.\\n[6] L’intimé n’est pas satisfait de ce niveau de divulgation et a expressément demandé que soient divulguées les sommes d’argent que les syndicats ont versées à la plaignante. Je tiens à préciser que je n’ai pas vu le compte rendu du règlement en question.\\n[7] Compte tenu du fait que les syndicats, qui ne sont pas parties à la présente instance, ont été les signataires de l’entente, j’ai jugé à propos de leur demander leur avis au sujet de cette question de divulgation. Ils ont exprimé leur position commune dans une lettre signée par M. Craig Spencer, conseiller juridique à la Direction des programmes des membres de l’AFPC. Les syndicats partagent l’avis de la plaignante et de la Commission, à savoir que le compte rendu du règlement ne devrait pas être divulgué dans son intégralité. Les objections de la Commission et de la plaignante semblent se limiter à la divulgation des sommes d’argent proprement dites. La Commission et la plaignante sont réceptives à l’idée de communiquer le reste du compte rendu du règlement.\\nI. S’AGIT‑IL D’UN DOCUMENT PERTINENT À L’ÉGARD D’UNE QUESTION EN LITIGE? [8] Les syndicats soutiennent, apparemment avec l’accord de la Commission et de la plaignante, que les questions qui étaient en cause dans les plaintes qui ont été réglées n’ont absolument aucun rapport avec les litiges ayant donné lieu à la plainte contre l’intimé. Cette dernière plainte porte sur des faits et gestes particuliers qui violeraient la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi). En revanche, les plaintes portées contre les syndicats, bien qu’elles découlent des présumés faits et gestes de l’intimé, sont distinctes du fait qu’elles ont trait particulièrement au cadre administratif établi par l’AFPC et le SEPC en vue de l’examen des plaintes de harcèlement dans le cadre d’activités syndicales. Comme on peut le constater à la lecture du libellé des plaintes portées contre le syndicat, la plaignante est d’avis que le système de traitement des plaintes de harcèlement mis en place par les syndicats n’a pas permis d’examiner en temps opportun ses préoccupations.\\n[9] En fait, les deux plaintes dont ces organismes syndicaux ont fait l’objet portaient en bonne partie sur la piètre façon dont les dirigeants syndicaux ont traité ses plaintes à l’égard de la conduite de l’intimé. Dans la plainte relative aux droits de la personne déposée auprès de la Commission, il est allégué que l’intimé a contrevenu à l’article 14 de la Loi uniquement. Cet article précise que le fait de harceler un individu constitue un acte discriminatoire s’il est fondé sur un des motifs de discrimination illicite, y compris le sexe. Cependant, dans le cas des plaintes portées contre les syndicats, il est allégué que non seulement l’article 14 a été enfreint, mais aussi les articles 7 et 9. Aux termes de l’article 7, le fait de défavoriser un individu en cours d’emploi constitue un acte discriminatoire et, élément plus important, le fait d’empêcher l’adhésion d’un individu ou d’expulser ou de suspendre un adhérent constitue, en vertu de l’art. 9, un acte discriminatoire s’il est fondé sur un des motifs de distinction illicite, y compris le sexe. Par conséquent, la responsabilité que la Commission a cherché à imputer aux syndicats était fondée, du moins en partie, sur la façon dont ils avaient traité leur membre à la suite de ses allégations voulant qu’un autre membre de l’exécutif l’ait harcelée sexuellement.\\n[10] Les syndicats font valoir qu’ils auraient pu être jugés responsables, peu importe le résultat de la plainte déposée contre l’intimé. Leur avocat a indiqué que si le Tribunal devait conclure que l’intimé n’a pas harcelé la plaignante, les syndicats ne chercheraient pas à rouvrir l’entente ou à la faire invalider.\\n[11] On a fait remarquer que les seuls éléments importants de l’entente qui n’ont pas été divulgués sont les sommes d’argent. Compte tenu de la responsabilité distincte des syndicats, d’une part, et de l’intimé, d’autre part, les montants d’argent versés à la plaignante par les syndicats ne sont pas pertinents à l’égard des indemnités qu’elle réclame à l’intimé. La Commission a fait observer que, selon le sommaire du compte rendu du règlement mentionné ci‑dessus, l’indemnité versée à la plaignante par les syndicats visait strictement à compenser, en vertu de l’alinéa 53(2)e) de la Loi, le préjudice moral qu’elle avait subi. Aucune indemnité n’a été versée à l’égard des pertes salariales (c.‑à‑d., les honoraires auxquels avaient droit les dirigeants syndicaux) ou des dépens. Revenons‑en à la présente affaire. La lettre conjointe de précisions de la Commission et de la plaignante indique que celle‑ci exige que l’intimé l’indemnise de ses dépens et lui verse une indemnité pour préjudice moral, conformément à l’alinéa 53(2)e).\\n[12] Par conséquent, une indemnisation pour préjudice moral a été réclamée à l’intimé de même qu’aux syndicats. La Commission a fait valoir que ces réclamations ne sont néanmoins pas reliées. La plaignante avait droit selon la Loi de réclamer contre chacun des intimés initiaux une indemnité pour préjudice moral pouvant atteindre 20 000 $ (indemnité maximale). L’avocat de la Commission m’a cité les conclusions énoncées dans Ghosh v. Domglas Inc. (No. 2) en ce qui concerne le redressement prévu par le Code ontarien des droits de la personne, qui autorise une commission d’enquête à accorder une indemnité pouvant atteindre 10 000 $ pour souffrance morale. La commission d’enquête a déclaré :\\n[TRADUCTION] Bien qu’il limite le montant pouvant être accordé à titre d’indemnisation pour dommages moraux, le Code n’impose pas de restrictions quant au nombre d’indemnités qu’une commission d’enquête peut ordonner de verser au terme d’une audience dans les cas où elle estime que des droits distincts ont été enfreints dans le cadre d’incidents différents ou de séries d’incidents différentes, peu importe si les intimés sont les mêmes ou s’il s’agit d’intimés différents.\\nUne conclusion similaire a été énoncée dans une décision rendue plus récemment par une commission d’enquête de l’Ontario dans l’affaire Moffat v. Kinark Child and Family Services.\\n[13] De l’avis de la Commission, on peut étendre ce même raisonnement aux mesures de redressement prévues par la Loi et notamment par son alinéa 50(2)e). Si le droit à réparation pour préjudice moral est propre à chaque plainte, les montants que la plaignante a reçus des syndicats ne peuvent être déduits de ce qu’elle réclame à l’intimé. Par conséquent, les montants que la plaignante peut avoir reçus des autres intimés ne sont pas pertinents à l’égard de l’indemnisation pour préjudice moral qu’elle a demandé à l’intimé en l’espèce.\\n[14] Cet argument est fondé sur le principe que le Tribunal sera en mesure de distinguer le préjudice moral que l’intimé a infligé à la plaignante de celui découlant de la conduite des syndicats. Il est possible que le Tribunal ne soit pas à même de faire une telle distinction. Les trois plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne et la lettre conjointe de précisions incitent toutes à croire que les faits et gestes des syndicats ainsi que leurs omissions sont survenus en bonne partie à l’époque même où l’intimé a présumément harcelé la plaignante. Si je fais droit à la plainte contre l’intimé et conclus que la plaignante a subi un préjudice moral au cours de la période visée, il se peut fort bien que je ne sois pas en mesure de distinguer le préjudice causé par la conduite de l’intimé de celui découlant de la conduite des syndicats. Le cas échéant, l’intimé pourrait soutenir qu’on ne devrait pas lui ordonner d’indemniser la plaignante pour l’ensemble du préjudice moral subi. La divulgation des sommes d’argent que la plaignante peut avoir reçues des syndicats est pertinente à l’égard d’une question en litige en l’espèce, à tout le moins pour éviter une double indemnisation de la plaignante. J’estime que le compte rendu du règlement pourrait être pertinent, ne serait‑ce que pour ce motif.\\n[15] Cependant, la responsabilité des syndicats est-elle aussi distincte qu’on le prétend? Il est vrai qu’il est fait mention, dans les plaintes dont les organismes syndicaux ont été l’objet, des articles 7 et 9 de la Loi et de la conduite particulière des syndicats et de leurs représentants. Toutefois, selon la lettre conjointe de précisions de la Commission et de la plaignante, qui a été rédigée avant le règlement des plaintes portées contre les syndicats, l’une des questions à trancher en l’espèce est la suivante :\\nEst‑ce que les syndicats intimés, soit le SEPC et l’AFPC, ont pris toutes les mesures nécessaires pour empêcher les actes de harcèlement ou atténuer leurs effets sur la plaignante, comme le veut l’art. 65 de la Loi?\\nLe par. 65(1) est la disposition de la Loi en vertu de laquelle les actes ou omissions commis par un employé, un mandataire, un administrateur ou un dirigeant sont réputés avoir été commis par l’organisme; autrement dit, il s’agit de la disposition traitant de la responsabilité du fait d’autrui. Selon le paragraphe 65(2), l’organisme peut se disculper en faisant la preuve qu’il n’a pas consenti aux actes ou omissions en question, qu’il a pris toutes les mesures nécessaires pour les empêcher et qu’il a tenté par la suite d’en atténuer les effets.\\n[16] Le fait que la plaignante et la Commission fassent mention de l’article 65 laisse entendre que la responsabilité des syndicats pourrait découler de la responsabilité principale du présumé harceleur, l’intimé. Le cas échéant, les organismes peuvent être condamnés individuellement et conjointement avec leurs dirigeants, leurs administrateurs, leurs employés ou leurs mandataires à indemniser la plaignante. Voici l’explication qu’on trouve à cet égard dans la décision Moffat :\\n[TRADUCTION] Dans les cas où l’entreprise intimée est jugé responsable de la conduite discriminatoire de l’individu mis en cause, l’ordonnance stipule que l’entreprise intimée est individuellement et conjointement responsable avec l’individu de l’indemnisation à l’égard de cette conduite.\\nDans Moffat, la commission d’enquête a ajouté que le fait de conclure à une responsabilité du fait d’autrui ne justifie pas l’octroi d’une indemnité distincte à l’égard de cette responsabilité.\\n[17] Par conséquent, on pourrait certainement faire valoir que la présumée responsabilité des syndicats découle de la responsabilité du fait de l’intimé et que les montants reçus en guise de règlement des plaintes portées contre les syndicats devraient être déduits de l’indemnité réclamée à l’intimé par la plaignante. Les montants versés en guise de règlement deviennent donc pertinents à l’égard de la preuve de l’intimé.\\n[18] Pour tous ces motifs, je suis persuadé que le compte rendu du règlement est pertinent à l’égard d’une question à trancher en l’espèce, soit celle qui consiste à déterminer le montant que l’intimé peut être tenu de verser en guise d’indemnité s’il est jugé responsable.\\nII. LE DOCUMENT LITIGIEUX EST‑IL PRIVILÉGIÉ? [19] Dans ses arguments écrits, l’avocat des syndicats a fait observer que, dans la pratique, les parties aux négociations en vue d’un règlement s’engagent à préserver la stricte confidentialité des négociations, [TRADUCTION] et ce afin de les inciter à concilier leurs divergences et à éviter des poursuites judiciaires. L’intérêt qu’a la société à l’égard de l’entente est protégé grâce au processus d’examen et d’approbation auquel doit se livrer la Commission, conformément à l’article 48 de la Loi, pour que le règlement puisse être exécuté.\\n[20] Afin de favoriser la réalisation de ces objectifs, les tribunaux protègent en fait contre la divulgation les communications faites en vue d’une réconciliation ou d’un aménagement. Toutefois, comme l’ont expliqué Sopinka, Lederman et Bryant, si les négociations ont été couronnées de succès et mènent à une entente mutuelle et que c’est l’interprétation ou l’entente elle-même qui est en litige, il est alors possible d’utiliser les communications comme preuve du règlement. Je note que l’analyse que les auteurs ont faite de ce privilège semble graviter autour des communications ayant mené au règlement, et non autour de l’entente proprement dite. Je conclus implicitement que le compte rendu du règlement ne serait pas visé par le privilège. Quoi qu’il en soit, je suis persuadé que les questions touchant l’évaluation du redressement pour préjudice moral sont des éléments qui ont trait à l’interprétation de l’entente proprement dite. Je ne suis donc pas convaincu que le compte rendu du règlement est privilégié.\\nIII. CONCLUSION ET ORDONNANCE [21] J’ordonne à la Commission et à la plaignante de communiquer à l’intimé, avant 16 h le jeudi 13 février 2003, le compte rendu du règlement conclu avec l’AFPC et le SEPC. Cette communication prendra la forme de copies du document, conformément au paragraphe 6(3) des Règles de procédure provisoires du Tribunal.\\n[22] Afin de dissiper certaines des préoccupations en matière de confidentialité, j’ordonne la divulgation du document aux conditions suivantes :\\nl’intimé ne doit consulter le document qu’aux fins de l’audience; l’intimé ne doit pas divulguer ni le document ni son contenu à qui que ce soit, sauf à son avocat, s’il en a un; l’intimé ne doit pas faire de copies du document en question et doit retourner celui‑ci à la Commission dans la semaine qui suivra la clôture de l’audience en l’espèce.\\n[23] Toute préoccupation similaire concernant la recevabilité du document en preuve à l’audience pourra être examinée dans le cours de celle‑ci, peut-être dans le cadre d’une requête visant à tenir les délibérations à huis clos.\\nAthanasios D.

Hadjis\\n2003 CHRT 46 2003/10/29\\n[1] The Complainant wishes to call upon Dr. Harish C. Jain, Professor Emeritus, Human Resources and Labour Relations at the MGD School of Business of McMaster University, to testify in the present case as an expert. The Complainant proposes to qualify Prof. Jain as an expert in the field of systemic discrimination, discrimination in the large sense and racial prejudice in the workplace, from the perspective of a social scientist.\\n[2] The Respondent has taken issue with Prof. Jain's proposed qualification for the purpose of this expert testimony. In addition, the Respondent questions the relevance and necessity of this proposed evidence.\\n[3] The Respondent presented its objection after Prof. Jain had completed his testimony with regard solely to the matter of his qualification as an expert. On the consent of the parties, a copy of Prof. Jain's report detailing his intended evidence was provided to me to assist in my deliberations.\\n[4] An analysis regarding the admissibility of expert evidence should be conducted in accordance with the leading decision of the Supreme Court of Canada on this subject, in the case of R. v. Mohan, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9. The Court pointed out that the admission of expert evidence depends upon the application of the following criteria:\\nRelevance; Necessity in assisting the trier of fact; The absence of any exclusionary rule; A properly qualified expert.\\n[5] Accordingly, the first two questions for me to consider are the following: Is the proposed evidence of Prof. Jain relevant, and if so, is it necessary in assisting the Tribunal?\\n[6] On the question of relevance, the Court in Mohan noted the following, at paragraph 18:\\nRelevance is a threshold requirement for the admission of expert evidence as with all other evidence. Relevance is a matter to be decided by a judge as question of law. Although prima facie admissible if so related to a fact in issue that it tends to establish it, that does not end the inquiry. This merely determines the logical relevance of the evidence. Other considerations enter into the decision as to admissibility. This further inquiry may be described as a cost benefit analysis, that is whether its value is worth what it costs. See McCormick on Evidence (3rd ed. 1984), at p. 544. Cost in this context is not used in its traditional economic sense but rather in terms of its impact on the trial process. Evidence that is otherwise logically relevant may be excluded on this basis, if its probative value is overborne by its prejudicial effect, if it involves an inordinate amount of time which is not commensurate with its value or if it is misleading in the sense that its effect on the trier of fact, particularly a jury, is out of proportion to its reliability.\\n[7] On the issue of necessity, the Court in Mohan cites, at paragraph 21, from its prior decision in the case of R. v. Abbey, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 24:\\nWith respect to matters calling for special knowledge, an expert in the field may draw inferences and state his opinion. An expert's function is precisely this: to provide the judge and jury with a ready-made inference which the judge and jury, due to the technical nature of the facts, are unable to formulate. An expert's opinion is admissible to furnish the Court with scientific information which is likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of a judge or jury. If on the proven facts a judge or jury can form their own conclusions without help, then the opinion of the expert is unnecessary (Turner (1974), 60 Crim. App. R. 80, at p. 83, per Lawton L.J.)\\n[8] The Supreme Court goes on to say, in Mohan, at paragraph 22:\\nThis pre-condition is often expressed in terms as to whether the evidence would be helpful to the trier of fact. The word helpful is not quite appropriate and sets too low a standard. However, I would not judge necessity by too strict a standard. What is required is that the opinion be necessary in the sense that it provide information which is likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of a judge or jury: as quoted by Dickson J. in R. v. Abbey, supra. As stated by Dickson J., the evidence must be necessary to enable the trier of fact to appreciate the matters in issue due to their technical nature.\\n[emphasis added]\\n[9] There are essentially two parts to the proposed evidence of Prof. Jain, as advanced in his report. The first is in the form of an introductory explanation of some of the causes of racial discrimination in the workplace. There is no explicit reference, within this aspect of the evidence, to the RCMP or to the specific facts alleged in the complaint.\\n[10] The second portion of the proposed expert evidence is described as a quantitative analysis of the scope, nature and trends of racial discrimination in employment in Canada over the last two decades, based on a sample of 119 cases published by the Canadian Human Rights Reporter between 1980 and 1999. This is followed up with a qualitative analysis, based upon selected cases, with respect to patterns of behaviour and employment conditions that lead to discriminatory treatment of racial minorities in the workplace, that the witness points out is meant to be illustrative. These analyses are occasionally interspersed with comments by Prof. Jain to the effect that in his opinion, many of the incidents alleged in the complaint reflect some of the patterns of discrimination documented in Canadian human rights case law.\\n[11] I find that the first part of the proposed evidence is of minimal probative value to this case. While knowledge of the root causes of racism in the workplace is vital to our society's ongoing quest to eradicate all forms of discrimination, I fail to see how general evidence relating thereto can be of assistance in determining whether the specific discriminatory conduct alleged in the complaint occurred in fact. The time to be expended to receive this evidence will not be commensurate with its probative value.\\n[12] With respect to the second aspect of the proposed evidence, I have no doubt that a review of the relevant jurisprudence in the area of racial discrimination will be of assistance to me when it comes down to making my findings and issuing my decision, once all of the evidence of the Complainant and the Respondent will have been led. I fully expect each party's learned and able counsel to apprise me of all the relevant case law and other authorities, and to bring up any analogous facts on the basis of which I will be urged to reach similar findings and conclusions. Conducting this form of analysis falls squarely within the scope of the Tribunal's functions. The Supreme Court of Canada has observed on several occasions that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal has a superior expertise as it relates to fact finding and adjudication in the human rights context. (See, for instance, R v. Mossop, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 554).The Tribunal is thus able to draw the very inferences and conclusions that Prof. Jain has made in his report. I am not persuaded, therefore, that the second facet of his proposed evidence will fall outside the experience and knowledge of the Tribunal. The condition of necessity articulated in Mohan has not been satisfied.\\n[13] For these reasons alone, the Respondent's objection is maintained and the proposed evidence of Prof. Jain is not admitted. The question of his qualifications for the purposes of his testimony in this case thus becomes moot and need not be explored.\\nI hereby certify that the foregoing is a true and accurate representation of my ruling given to the parties in the above-noted matter on October 29, 2003.

Hadjis\\n2003 TCDP 46\\n2003/10/29\\n[TRADUCTION]\\n[1] La partie plaignante désire appeler à témoigner à titre d'expert en l'espèce M. Harish C. Jain, professeur émérite en ressources humaines et relations de travail à la MDG School of Business de l'Université McMaster. La partie plaignante propose de reconnaître le professeur Jain comme [TRADUCTION] un spécialiste en matière de discrimination systémique, de discrimination au sens large et de préjugés raciaux en milieu de travail, du point de vue des sciences sociales.\\n[2] La partie intimée s'oppose à ce que le professeur Jain soit reconnu comme expert aux fins de cette preuve d'expert. En outre, elle conteste la pertinence et la nécessité de la preuve proposée.\\n[3] La partie intimée a présenté son objection après que le professeur Jain eut terminé son témoignage portant strictement sur sa compétence à titre d'expert. Avec l'accord des parties, une copie du rapport du professeur Jain décrivant en détail la preuve qu'il entend présenter m'a été fournie pour m'aider dans mes délibérations.\\n[4] L'analyse de l'admissibilité de la preuve d'expert doit être effectuée conformément à l'arrêt clé rendu par la Cour suprême du Canada à ce sujet, c'est-à-dire R. c. Mohan, [1994] 2 R.C.S. 9. La Cour a souligné que l'admission de la preuve d'expert repose sur l'application des critères suivants :\\nla pertinence; la nécessité d'aider le juge des faits; l'absence de toute règle d'exclusion; 4. la qualification suffisante de l'expert.\\n[5] Par conséquent, je dois d'abord me pencher sur la double question suivante : le témoignage qu'entend présenter le professeur Jain est-il pertinent et, le cas échéant, est-il nécessaire pour aider le Tribunal?\\n[6] Au sujet de la question de la pertinence, la Cour a fait remarquer dans Mohan (paragraphe 18) ce qui suit :\\nComme pour toute autre preuve, la pertinence est une exigence liminaire pour l'admission d'une preuve d'expert. La pertinence est déterminée par le juge comme question de droit. Bien que la preuve soit admissible à première vue si elle est à ce point liée au fait concerné qu'elle tend à l'établir, l'analyse ne se termine pas là. Cela établit seulement la pertinence logique de la preuve. D'autres considérations influent également sur la décision relative à l'admissibilité. Cet examen supplémentaire peut être décrit comme une analyse du coût et des bénéfices, à savoir si la valeur en vaut le coût. Voir McCormick on Evidence (3e éd. 1984), à la p. 544. Le coût dans ce contexte n'est pas utilisé dans le sens économique traditionnel du terme, mais plutôt par rapport à son impact sur le procès. La preuve qui est par ailleurs logiquement pertinente peut être exclue sur ce fondement si sa valeur probante est surpassée par son effet préjudiciable, si elle exige un temps excessivement long qui est sans commune mesure avec sa valeur ou si elle peut induire en erreur en ce sens que son effet sur le juge des faits, en particulier le jury, est disproportionné par rapport à sa fiabilité.\\n[7] À propos de la nécessité, la Cour, dans Mohan, cite (au paragraphe 21) un extrait d'un arrêt antérieur - R. c. Abbey, [1982] 2 R.C.S. 24 :\\nQuant aux questions qui exigent des connaissances particulières, un expert dans le domaine peut tirer des conclusions et exprimer son avis. Le rôle d'un expert est précisément de fournir au juge et au jury une conclusion toute faite que ces derniers, en raison de la technicité des faits, sont incapables de formuler. [TRADUCTION] L'opinion d'un expert est recevable pour donner à la cour des renseignements scientifiques qui, selon toute vraisemblance, dépassent l'expérience et la connaissance d'un juge ou d'un jury. Si, à partir des faits établis par la preuve, un juge ou un jury peut à lui seul tirer ses propres conclusions, alors l'opinion de l'expert n'est pas nécessaire (Turner (1974), 60 Crim. App. R. 80, à la p. 83, le lord juge Lawton).\\n[8] La Cour suprême, dans Mohan, ajoute ce qui suit (paragraphe 22) :\\nCette condition préalable est fréquemment reprise dans la question de savoir si la preuve serait utile au juge des faits. Le mot utile n'est pas tout à fait juste car il établit un seuil trop bas. Toutefois, je ne jugerais pas la nécessité selon une norme trop stricte. L'exigence est que l'opinion soit nécessaire au sens qu'elle fournit des renseignements qui, selon toute vraisemblance, dépassent l'expérience et la connaissance d'un juge ou d'un jury : cité par le juge Dickson, dans Abbey, précité. Comme le juge Dickson l'a dit, la preuve doit être nécessaire pour permettre au juge des faits d'apprécier les questions en litige étant donné leur nature technique.\\n[c'est nous qui soulignons]\\n[9] La preuve qu'entend présenter le professeur Jain comporte essentiellement deux volets, selon son rapport. Le premier volet prend la forme d'un exposé décrivant certaines des causes de la discrimination raciale en milieu de travail. Cet aspect de la preuve ne comporte aucune référence explicite à la GRC ou aux faits particuliers allégués dans la plainte.\\n[10] Le deuxième volet de la preuve d'expert proposée se veut une [TRADUCTION] analyse quantitative de la portée, de la nature et des tendances de la discrimination raciale dans l'emploi au Canada au cours des deux dernières décennies. Cette analyse repose sur un échantillon de 119 décisions publiées dans le Canadian Human Rights Reporter entre 1980 et 1999. L'analyse en question est suivie d'une analyse qualitative, fondée sur un certain nombre d'affaires, des [TRADUCTION] schèmes de comportement et des conditions d'emploi qui peuvent entraîner un traitement discriminatoire des minorités raciales en milieu de travail, analyse que le témoin qualifie d'illustrative. Ces analyses sont parfois entrecoupées d'observations du professeur Jain selon lesquelles, à son avis, un grand nombre des incidents dont il est fait état dans la plainte sont le reflet de certaines des tendances de discrimination dont atteste la jurisprudence canadienne relative aux droits de la personne.\\n[11] À mon avis, le premier volet de la preuve que le professeur Jain entend présenter a une valeur probatoire minimale en l'espèce. Bien que les connaissances des causes profondes du racisme au travail soient cruciales du point de vue de la quête incessante de notre société pour enrayer toutes les formes de discrimination, je ne vois pas comment une preuve générale à ce sujet pourra aider à déterminer si le présumé comportement discriminatoire décrit dans la plainte s'est bel et bien produit. Le temps qui sera consacré à l'audition de cette preuve sera sans commune mesure avec sa valeur probatoire.\\n[12] En ce qui concerne le deuxième aspect de la preuve proposée, il ne fait aucun doute à mon avis qu'une revue de la jurisprudence pertinente dans le domaine de la discrimination raciale m'aidera à tirer mes conclusions et à rendre ma décision, une fois que l'ensemble de la preuve aura été présenté par la partie plaignante et la partie intimée. Je compte pleinement sur les avocats savants et compétents qui représentent chaque partie pour me signaler toute la jurisprudence pertinente et les autres sources faisant autorité et pour porter à ma connaissance des faits analogues sur lesquels je serai prié de me fonder pour parvenir à des conclusions similaires. Ce genre d'analyse fait certes partie des attributions du Tribunal. La Cour suprême du Canada a fait remarquer à plusieurs occasions que le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne possède une expertise supérieure en ce qui concerne l'appréciation des faits et les décisions dans un contexte de droits de la personne. Par conséquent, je ne suis pas persuadé que le deuxième volet de la preuve proposée dépasse le champ d'expérience et de connaissances du Tribunal. La condition de nécessité énoncée dans Mohan n'est pas satisfaite.\\n[13] Pour les motifs énoncés ci-dessus, l'objection de la partie intimée est accueillie et la preuve qu'entendait présenter le professeur Jain n'est pas jugée admissible. La question de ses compétences aux fins de son témoignage en l'espèce devient donc sans objet et n'a pas à être examinée.\\nJe certifie par la présente que ce document est une représentation conforme et exacte de ma décision sur requête émise aux parties le 29 octobre 2003 dans l'affaire ci-haut mentionnée.\\nAthanasios D.
